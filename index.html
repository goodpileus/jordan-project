  <p>Early one morning in late March, 2032, thejordanproject's <u>proprietary crime-tracking algorithm</u> alerted us to <a href="files/freeman-widow.gif">three separate crimes</a> that had, according to various news reports, happened the previous night.</p>

  <p>Though taking place in different locations spread out across the city, it is (according to math) theoretically possible that the deaths occurred in a sequence, perpetrated by a single killer.  The algo marked all three as 'suspicious' and 'connected'.</p>
    
  <p>With the help of a college friend, the private detective (and former deputy of the Yorke County District Attorney's Office) Mitchell Cox, we were able to investigate the single killer theory further.  Our pursuit of suspects led to the name "Delphine Amáro".</p>
    
  <p>Everything, including gender and actual name, regarding Ms Amáro is unknown or impossible at present to verify.  Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to the local police department produced the following diary entry and sound recording, authored by the suspect.  These documents' relation to the official investigation is unknown.  Mitch too is off the grid, but that is nothing new.</p>
